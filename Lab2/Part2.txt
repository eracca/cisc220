Data Structure Project 1: Music Suggestion Algorithm
In this project, the user would upload a song to the program. The program would then
analyze the beats per minute in the song and try to suggest similar music from a
library of songs. The library would sort music by beats per minute and then match the
song that you uploaded with other songs that have the same bpm. On top of this,
you could also use user data to see what music others listened to after listening
to the song that you uploaded because the there is usually a corellation.


Data Structure Project 2: Undo button
This program lets you input a text file and then output it once you're finished.
It would store the information in a way that if a letters are typed within a second
of each other they would be stored together. But if each character is entered in
separately with delays, then each character would be stored at a time. An undo
button will be available, every time you click the undo button the program would 
delete the last portion of the file that you entered instead of deleting one
character at a time. This would make it easier to delete and undo changes made.


Data Structure Project 3: Informational picture
This program would have a library of images. Say each image is a 1000x1000 pixel image,
the picture would allow the user to hover over certain points of the picture which then
enables the program to display information about the picture. So if a car takes up space
on the picture from (200,200) -> (400,400) while the user has the mouse in that area, the program
would give you information about the car in the picture.  This could be done by
creating an 2 dimensional array which would be layed over the picture, every time
a portion of the array is hovered over, then the program will display a message
regarding that portion of the picture.
